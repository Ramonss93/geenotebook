## Hansen Global Forest Change
Results from time-series analysis of Landsat images characterizing forest extent and change. Please see the User Notes for this Version 1.2 update at: http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest/download_v1.2.html as well as the associated journal article: Hansen, Potapov, Moore, Hancher et al. “High-resolution global maps of 21st-century forest cover change.” Science 342.6160 (2013): 850-853.

Tree canopy cover for year 2000 (“treecover2000”) is defined as canopy closure for all vegetation taller than 5m in height and encoded as a percentage per output grid cell, in the range 0–100. Forest loss during the period 2000–2014 (“loss”) is defined as a stand-replacement disturbance, or a change from a forest to non-forest state, encoded as either 1 (loss) or 0 (no loss). Forest gain during the period 2000–2012 (“gain”) is defined as the inverse of loss, or a non-forest to forest change entirely within the study period. The year of gross forest cover loss (“lossyear”) is a disaggregation of total forest loss to annual time scales, encoded as either 0 (no loss) or else a value in the range 1–14, representing loss detected primarily in the year 2001–2014, respectively. The data mask (“datamask”) has three values representing areas of no data (0), mapped land surface (1), and permanent water bodies (2).

Reference composite imagery represent median observations from a set of quality assessed growing season observations in four spectral bands, specifically Landsat ETM+ bands 3, 4, 5, and 7. Bands “first_30”, “first_40“, “first_50“, and “first_70“ are reference multispectral imagery from the first available year, typically 2000. Bands “last_30”, “last_40“, “last_50“, and “last_70“ are reference multispectral imagery from the last available year, typically 2014.
