Crop exports from Africa change depending on global demand, land availability and other factors. Some cash crops emerged relatively recently in African history. Others, however, date back many years. Coffee production, for instance, originated in Africa, first appearing in French Guyana during the 18th century. Several African nations, including Ethiopia, Cote d'Ivoire and Uganda, rank among the leading global coffee producers. Ethiopia exports most of Africa's coffee. Its farms yield slightly less than 4 million pounds each year and employ 12 million citizens. This nation specializes in arabica beans while Cote d'Ivoire and Uganda export robusta beans.
