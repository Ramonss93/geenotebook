Ensemble classifiers in remote sensing
--------------------------------------------
- Supervised parametric classifiers 
  1. Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) deliver excellent results when dealing with unimodal data. However, they have limitations when dealing with multi-modal input datasets because these classifiers assume a normal data distribution (Liu et al., 2011). 
- Non-parametric supervised classifiers do not make any assumptions regarding frequency distribution and have therefore become increasingly popular for classifying remotely sensed data, which rarely have normal distributions
  1. Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
  1. Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Mountrakis et al., 2011), and 
  1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (Mas and Flores, 2007) classifiers

most significant human impacts on the land system can
be captured at this scale, a number of researchers are focusing on such products. This paper reports
the operational approach used in such a project, which aims to deliver reliableequence and then results are merged together. For the identification of each class, a robust integration of pixel-and object-based classification was developed. To improve the quality of the classification results, a knowledge-based interactive verification procedure was developed with the support of web service technology. The performance of the POK-based approach was tested using
