Ensemble classifiers in remote sensing
--------------------------------------------
- Supervised parametric classifiers 
  1. Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) deliver excellent results when dealing with unimodal data. However, they have limitations when dealing with multi-modal input datasets because these classifiers assume a normal data distribution (Liu et al., 2011). 
- Non-parametric supervised classifiers do not make any assumptions regarding frequency distribution and have therefore become increasingly popular for classifying remotely sensed data, which rarely have normal distributions
  1. Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
  1. Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Mountrakis et al., 2011), and 
  1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) (Mas and Flores, 2007) classifiers
