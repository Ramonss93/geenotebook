# Points about Tweedledee and Tweedledum

Much has been made of the curious features of 
Tweedledee and Tweedledum.  We propose here to
set some of the controversy to rest and to uproot
all of the more outlandish claims.

# Points about the facts

In recent years, more and more attention has been 
paid to opinion, less and less to what were formerly 
called the cold, hard facts.  In a spirit of traditionalism, 
we propose to reverse the trend. Here are some of our results.

# Recent innovations (1): False presentation

Some, moved by opinion and an irrational lust for novelty, 
would introduce a non-factual element into the data, 
perhaps moving all the facts to the left:

-------     ------ ----------   -------
12          12     12           12
123         123    123          123

# Recent innovations (2): Illegitimate decoration

Others, preferring their facts to be *varnished*, 
as we might say, will tend to 'label' the columns

# Recent innovations (3): "Moderate" decoration

Or, maybe, to accompany this 'spin' with a centered or centrist representation:

----------  ------- ----------   -------

# The real enemy

Some even accompany these representations with a bit of leftwing 
clap-trap, suggesting the facts have drifted right:

If comment be needed, let it be thus:  the facts have drifted left.
